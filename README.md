# qr_reader_test

QR and BarCode Test Example.

## Getting Started

The objective of this exercise is to create an application that allows the user to read barcodes (barcodes, QR, etc). The application should display the camera preview and read the barcodes, which should be stored in a list.
Considerations:

- Feedback should be given to the user in the least invasive way when a reading has been done correctly.
- The list of stored codes should be displayed in some section of the app.
- It should be possible to remove codes from the list.
- If a code is a URL, it should be possible to redirect to it.
- If a reading finds more than one code, the user should be asked which code to add.
- Must be implemented using some software design with easy to test architecture.
- All functions must have unit tests.
- There is no a specific design or user experience to follow, feel free to make your own decisions.
